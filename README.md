## 📊 Risk Scoring Methodology

The risk score is calculated based on multiple factors:
- Credit score (30%): Lower score = higher risk
- Loan repayment history (30%): More missed payments = higher risk
- Loan to income ratio (25%): Higher ratio = higher risk
- Expense to income ratio (15%): Higher ratio = higher risk
